    "description": "I'm a geospatial developer at [Sparkgeo](https://sparkgeo.com/). I use technology, data and my understanding of location to solve problems.\n\nI've also worked at [Forte Consulting](https://www.forteconsulting.ca/) and [WSP](https://www.wsp.com/). I studied GIS, geography and geology at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nOver the years I've made a lot of maps, wrangled a lot of data and done a lot of data analysis. Most recently, I've been working on a topographic trail map of Squamish, BC.\n\nIn no particular order, technologies I like to work with include: JavaScript (especially React), PostGIS, Python, STAC, COGs AWS, Azure, Mapbox GL JS (I'm a certified Mapbox developer), OpenLayers, Leaflet, GDAL/OGR, QGIS and Blender"
